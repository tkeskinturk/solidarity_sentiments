Hello there! Welcome to the replication files for Keskint√ºrk and Kuyucu (2023).

This first RMarkdown document prepares the Varieties of Turkish Nationalism Survey for the analyses. See the data in our shared folder.

# Data Wrangling

## Directions

To facilitate interpretation, we are first going to recode all variables such that higher values indicate nationalist/conservative positions.

```{r}

df <- df |>
  mutate_at(
    .vars = c(
      # nationalism variables
      "nat01",
      "nat03",
      "nat04",
      "nat05",
      "nat06",
      "nat07",
      "nat08",
      "nat09",
      "nat10",
      "nat11",
      "nat12",
      "nat13",
      "nat14",
      # opinion variables
      "o_nomuslim",
      "o_refugee1",
      "o_refugee2",
      "o_violence",
      "o_foreigns",
      "o_abroads1",
      "o_abroads2"
    ),
    list(~ case_when(. == 1 ~ 5,
                     . == 2 ~ 4,
                     . == 3 ~ 3,
                     . == 4 ~ 2,
                     . == 5 ~ 1))
  )

```

## Labeling

OK, let's now categorize nationalism variables, so that we can interpret typologies more clearly later.

```{r}

df <- df |>
  rename(
    # part 1: national identification
    natident1 = nat01,
    ## "I define myself, first and foremost, as part of the Turkish nation."
    natident2 = nat02,
    ## "If I could be a citizen of another country, I would easily give up my citizenship."

    # part 2: national pride
    natpride1 = nat03,
    ## "Being part of the Turkish nation makes me proud."
    natpride2 = nat04,
    ## "Turkey's achievements in international competitions make me proud."
    
    # part 3: membership criteria
    natmembr1 = nat05,
    ## "Speaking Turkish is an indispensable condition of being Turkish."
    natmembr2 = nat06,
    ## "Kurds live in Turkey as equal citizens without any discrimination."
    natmembr3 = nat07,
    ## "I define myself first as a "Turk," and then as a citizen of the Republic of Turkey."
    natmembr4 = nat08,
    ## "I doubt the Turkishness of a non-Muslim."
    
    # part 4: national hubris
    nathubrs1 = nat09,
    ## "I consider my own nation superior to all other nations."
    nathubrs2 = nat10,
    ## "The contribution of Turks to world civilization is higher than other nations."
    nathubrs3 = nat11,
    ## "Turkey lags behind due to the interventions of internal and external enemies."
    nathubrs4 = nat13,
    ## "Discussing controversial events (e.g., the Armenians or the Kurdish issue) bothers me."

    # part 5: national culture and politics
    natcultr1 = nat12,
    ## "It is not race or religion that makes us who we are, but Turkish national culture."
    natcultr2 = nat14,
    ## "Every Turkish citizen has to respect the historical heritage of the country."
  )

```

## Normalization

OK, we processed the data. We are now going to create a second version of the data to use in the upcoming scripts. Before saving our dataset, we will normalize certain continuous variables such that we will have a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1.

```{r}

# helper function
normalize <- function(x) {
  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
}

# normalize

df <- df |>
  mutate_at(c(
    "age",
    "educ",
    "religiosity",
    "lifestyle",
    "ideology",
    "polint",
    "polinfo",
    "o_ethnomar",
    "o_educlang",
    "o_nomuslim",
    "o_refugee1",
    "o_refugee2",
    "o_violence",
    "o_foreigns",
    "o_abroads1",
    "o_abroads2"
  ), ~(normalize(.) |> as.vector()))

```

# Saving the Dataset

```{r}

save(df, file = "survey_dataframe_version2.R")

```

Proceed with the Step 2: Latent Class Analyses.
